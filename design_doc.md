# BM(E) House

## Context
Turtle graphics is an easy to use tool for learning programming as it gives quick visual feedback. Our task is to draw a house using Turtle Graphics, however we must collaborate on all the coding.

## Motivations
To learn how to collaborate and use GitHub.

## Solution
Create a house with 4 windows, 2 garage doors, 1 door, 2 trees, and 1+ cloud.

## Other possible solutions
NA

## Current Goals
Meet the requirements for the given house using the Turtle graphics library.

## Non-goals
- Adding additional house elements.
- Perfecting look of any of the given elements.
- Re-implementing the Turtle graphics library.

## Future goals
Make our house prettier or bigger.

## Detailed Design
- Set screen size (1500x1500)
- We will specify boxes where we want each element to exist in the main function
  - Specify bounds of house
  - Specify height of trees and distance from house
  - Specify height of cloud (and location)
  - Specify location and size of window
  - Specify location and size of door
  - Specify locations of garage doors
- Make functions to draw each individual element
  - House (and garage) - Nikita
  - Tree - Cassie
  - Cloud - Nikita
  - Window - Conor
  - Door - Conor
  - Garage Door - Cassie
  - *These functions should take in a location (x,y of bottom-left corner) and information about the size (width, height typically)*
  - *Make sure to set heading (setheading) at start of function and put down pen (pendown) - then pick up pen at end of function (penup)*
